# Peoposal
[Fireworks Live](tbd)

## Background
Fireworks is a fun single screen game that will simply allow users to witness a variety of fireworks upon key presses.

## Minimum Viable Product
Fireworks should have the following features:

- Predetermined keys should cause a firework animation to occur alongside an appropriate sound.
- Fireworks should fade away and not persist on the screen.
- There should be a display informing users to click on Alphabetic keystrokes.

There should also be an appropriate production Readme.

## Wireframe

This particular app will feature only a single display, alongside navlinks to my github, linkedin, and personal site.

## Technologies

This project will require the following technologies to implement:
- Javascript and `jquery` for firework logic and binding keypresses to fireworks.
- `howler.js` for keypresses to additionally cause some sound to play alongside the firework.
- `anime.js` for the actual firework animations.

## Timeline

### Day 1: Setup
**Objective:** Basic javascript project setup. Setup `webpack.config.js`, entry file, `package.json.` Install `howler.js` and `anime.js`.

### Day 2: Animations
**Objective:** Learn `anime.js` and hopefully create a number of firework animations.

### Day 3: Event Logic and Continue Animations
**Objective:** Map keystrokes to fireworks. If needed, spend more time on firework animations

### Day 4: Sound
**Objective:** Learn `howler.js` and find appropriate firework sound effects.

### Bonus features

- [ ] Add non-firework animations that may help enliven the display.
